# Competitive-Programming-Java-Libraries
My code lib for competitive programming

  #   Contents:

  # Reader.java Class:
  - Fast and efficient way to read input from System.in.
  
  # Writer.java Class:
  - Fast and efficient way to write output to System.out.
  
  # Graph.java Class Contains:
  - An Edge add system.
  - Both DFS and BFS base algorithms.
  
  # Util.java Class Contains:
  - An integer primality testing algorithm.
  - A sieve function which returns a boolean array with all the marked primes on it.
  - A GCD algorithm (greatest common divisor)
  - A ModInverse algorithm (using Euclid's gcd extended algorithm) to compute a^-1 % MOD 
  - An factorial initialization function.
  - nCr and nPr algorithms (also for values % MOD), they both require factorial initialization before used.
  - An upper bound utility. This takes as a parameter an array and a value and returns the smallest index i where (value > a[i])
  - A lower bound utility. This takes as a parameter an array and a value and returns the smallest index i where (value =< a[i])
  - Note: lower and higher bounds should be used on sorted arrays. They work as described even if the array contains duplicates.
